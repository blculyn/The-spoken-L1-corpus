# The-spoken-L1-corpus
The spoken L1 corpus represents present-day spoken Chinese (Putonghua) used in mainland China, which is designed as a comparable corpus to the spoken L2 corpus. It comprises L1-L1 conversational interactions between L1 speakers of Chinese and a native Chinese speaker (the corpus builder) in informal settings. This corpus contains 228,306  words of transcribed interaction gathered in 2018, featuring 22 L1 speakers of Chinese in 26 audio recordings.
